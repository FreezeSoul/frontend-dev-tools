# Build package

Webpack is currently the most popular JavaScript module packaging tool, and rollupjs has many well-known libraries in use such as: react, vue, ember, preact, three.js, moment, etc., probably because rollupjs is simple and powerful.

## [Babel](https://www.babeljs.cn)

## [TypeScript](https://www.tslang.cn/)

## [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

## [RollupJS](https://www.rollupjs.com/)

Like webpack, Rollup uses a new, standardized format for code modules, which are included in the ES6 version of JavaScript, rather than previous special solutions such as CommonJS and AMD. The ES6 module gives you the freedom and seamless use of the most useful stand-alone functions in your favorite library, and your project doesn't have to carry other unused code. The ES6 module will eventually be natively implemented by the browser, but the current Rollup will allow you to experience it in advance.

## [parcel](https://parceljs.org/)

Similar to webpack, the extremely fast zero-configuration web application packaging tool, with superior performance and simple configuration, is suitable for simple websites or applications.

## [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)

Similar to webpack, organize browser-side Javascript code in a way similar to node's require('modules').

### [Gulp](https://www.gulpjs.com.cn/)

The nodejs-based steam stream packaging script is easy to learn and use, clear in code, and uses less than half the amount of Grunt code.

### [Grunt](https://www.gruntjs.net/)

The oldest packaging tools, all of which are configured to agree to package scripts, which are costly and flexible.
